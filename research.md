My research can be broadly defined as touching economic questions as they relate to both time and space. For most of my graduate career, I have been funded by the [Freight Transportation Research Institute](http://ses.wsu.edu/fpti/) within the School of Economic Sciences at WSU; hence, my research tends to use transportation related data to answer economic questions. I have also dabbled in the economics of housing markets.

My research interests are in applied microeconomics, applied econometrics, and behavioral economics.

## Dissertation
The title of my dissertation is *Topics in Spatial-Temporal Economics*. The papers that make up my dissertation are:

1. En Route Reference Point Updating: Estimating Travel Decisions in the Presence of Unexpected Delays [job market paper]
2. A (Statistical) Moment in Time and Space: Detecting the Significance of Skewness on Route Choice
3. A Conduit of Prices: The Effect of the Transportation Network on Price Dispersion using Modern Data

The first paper looks at reference-point updating (a feature of [Prospect Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory)) within periods. The second paper adds evidence to whether including the 3rd moment (i.e. skewness) is useful in predicting the preferred route. The last paper explores using spatial-weighting matrices based on the transportation network in spatial analysis.

## Other Research

For the capstone project for the MS in Statistics, I looked at how price diffuses across significant geographic boundaries (i.e. mountains or the like) using [vector autoregressive models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_autoregression). The abstract for this paper is below:

> While it has been shown that housing prices diffuse across arbitrary political boundaries, does price also diffuse across natural geographic barriers? This paper develops a vector autoregressive model for a sample data set of Washington housing prices from the 4th quarter of 2007 through the 4th quarter of 2015. Regions are constructed such that the boundaries between them are more substantive (i.e. mountains) than arbitrary political lines. Additional vector autoregressive models with the inclusion of exogenous variables are also estimated. In general, the results are consistent across the models. However, due to small sample size and p-values on the boundary, the null hypothesis is only weakly rejected. That is, housing prices in Western Washington weakly Granger-cause housing prices in Eastern Washington.
