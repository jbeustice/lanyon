My research can be broadly defined as touching economic questions as they relate to both time and space. For most of my graduate career, I have been funded by the [Freight Transportation Research Institute](http://ses.wsu.edu/fpti/) within the School of Economic Sciences at WSU; hence, my research tends to use transportation related data to answer economic questions. I have also dabbled in the economics of housing markets.

My research interests are in applied microeconomics, applied econometrics, and behavioral economics.

## Dissertation
The title of my dissertation is *Topics in Spatial-Temporal Economics*. The papers that make up my dissertation are:

1. En Route Reference Point Updating: Estimating Travel Decisions in the Presence of Unexpected Delays [Job market paper]
2. A (Statistical) Moment in Time and Space: Detecting the Significance of Skewness on Route Choice
3. A Conduit of Prices: The Effect of the Transportation Network on Price Dispersion using Modern Data

The first paper looks at reference-point updating (a feature of Prospect Theory) within periods. The second paper adds evidence to whether including the 3rd moment (i.e. skewness) is useful in predicting the preferred route. The last paper explores using spatial-weighting matrices based on the transportation network in spatial analysis.

## Other Research

For the captsone project for the MS in Statistics, I looked at how price diffuses across significant geographic boundaries (i.e. mountains or the like) using [vector autoregressive models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_autoregression).
