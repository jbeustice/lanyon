My research can be broadly defined as touching economic questions as they relate to both time and space. For most of my graduate career, I have been funded by the [Freight Tansportation Research Institute](http://ses.wsu.edu/fpti/) within the School of Economic Sciences at WSU; hence, my research tends to touch on transportation related issues. I have also dabbled in the economics of housing markets.


## Dissertation
The title of my dissertation is *Topics in Spatial-Temporal Economics*. The papers that make up my dissertation are:

1. En Route Reference Point Updating: Estimating Travel Decisions in the Presence of Unexpected Delays

3. A Conduit of Prices: The Effect of the Transportation Network on Price Dispersion using Modern Data
