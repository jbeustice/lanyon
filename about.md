Here we are, in all our glory. That's me, my wife Alyssa, and our two kids, Thomas and Jacob. We are excited to be finishing up here at Washington State University and heading out on a new adventure. I am currently a graduate research assistant [Economics] at Washington State University, and an adjunct faculty member [Economics] at Brigham Young University. I am an economist with extensive training in economics and statistics, including the 'neccessary and sufficient' skills in computer science to solve complex problems. My research interests are in applied microeconomics, applied econometrics, and behavioral economics.

## A little background

I grew up in the great state of Cali-freakin-fornia [both Northern and Southern]. After high school, I left to study as an undergraduate at Brigham Young University, eventually deciding to major in Economics. I took two years off from university studies to serve as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in St. Petersburg, Russia. A few weeks after graduating from BYU, I started in the Revenue Management Department at US Airways [currently American Airlines].

Less than a year at US Airways, we left so that I could start work on a PhD in Economics at Washington State University. Along the way, I opted to fine-tune my statistical skills culminating in a master's degree in Statistics in 2016 [also from WSU].
