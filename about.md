![all for one]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/family.jpg)

I am currently a graduate research assistant [Economics] at Washington State University, and an adjunct faculty member [Economics] at Brigham Young University. I am an economist with extensive training in economics and statistics, including the 'neccessary and sufficient' skills in computer science to solve complex problems. My research interests are in applied microeconomics, applied econometrics, and behavioral economics. My research tends to use transportation related data to answer questions in these broad research areas. 

## A little background

I studied economics as an undergraduate at Brigham Young University. A few weeks after university, I started in the Revenue Management Department of US Airways [currently American Airlines].
